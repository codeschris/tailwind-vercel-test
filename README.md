# tailwind-vercel-test

This repository is a learning reference for the deployment of Static HTML pages using Tailwind CSS as the styling framework.

**Note:** _Linking of stylesheets should be direct and not branched_
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">
```

Refrain from:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="build/css/style.css">
```

The snippet above hindered styling from loading completely.

I hope this helped.
